From his heroic service to Vietnam, to his years as a prosecutor and lieutenant governor, through two decades in the United States Senate, he has devoted himself to this country. Farmers and scholars; statesmen and patriots who had traveled across an ocean to escape tyranny and persecution finally made real their declaration of independence at a Philadelphia convention that lasted through the spring of 1787. I don't fit the typical pedigree, and I haven't spent my career in the halls of Washington. What the nay-sayers don't understand is that this election has never been about me.
</p>
<p>
And Ashley asks him why he's there. These are not whiners.
</p>
<p>
Bill, bought a house through F.H.A., and later moved west all the way to Hawaii in search of opportunity. John Edwards calls on us to hope. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. Why else would he define middle-class as someone making under five million dollars a year? How else could he propose hundreds of billions in tax breaks for big corporations and oil companies but not one penny of tax relief to more than one hundred million Americans? How else could he offer a health care plan that would actually tax people's benefits, or an education plan that would do nothing to help families pay for college, or a plan that would privatize Social Security and gamble your retirement? That experience guides my conviction that partnership between America and Islam must be based on what Islam is, not what it isn't. Around the world, the Jewish people were persecuted for centuries, and anti-Semitism in Europe culminated in an unprecedented Holocaust.
</p>
<p>
If there's an Arab American family being rounded up without benefit of an attorney or due process, that threatens my civil liberties. So one Sunday, I put on one of the few clean jackets I had, and went over to Trinity United Church of Christ on 95th Street on the South Side of Chicago. So let me spell out exactly what that change would mean if I am President. We are the party of Roosevelt. Because I've seen it.
</p>
<p>
Hope in the face of difficulty. The document they produced was eventually signed but ultimately unfinished. In the young people who voted for the first time, and in those who got involved again after a very long time. And it is no coincidence that countries where women are well-educated are far more likely to be prosperous. There is so much fear, so much mistrust.
</p>
<p>
But we shouldn't use our humility as an excuse for inaction. Did I know him to be an occasionally fierce critic of American domestic and foreign policy? Of course. Instead, they expressed a profoundly distorted view of this country - a view that sees white racism as endemic, and that elevates what is wrong with America above all that we know is right with America; a view that sees the conflicts in the Middle East as rooted primarily in the actions of stalwart allies like Israel, instead of emanating from the perverse and hateful ideologies of radical Islam. The times are too serious, the stakes are too high for this same partisan playbook.
</p>
<p>
For alongside our famous individualism, there's another ingredient in the American saga. It's the hope of slaves sitting around a fire singing freedom songs.
</p>
<p>
They are full of dancing, clapping, screaming and shouting that may seem jarring to the untrained ear. Individual responsibility and mutual responsibility - that's the essence of America's promise. And it is that promise that forty five years ago today, brought Americans from every corner of this land to stand together on a Mall in Washington, before Lincoln's Memorial, and hear a young preacher from Georgia speak of his dream.
</p>
<p>
We coach Little League in the Blue States and yes, we've got some gay friends in the Red States. But the truth is, that isn't all that I know of the man. For the African-American community, that path means embracing the burdens of our past without becoming victims of our past. Resistance through violence and killing is wrong and does not succeed. But it should be their choice. But we have a responsibility to join together on behalf of the world we seek - a world where extremists no longer threaten our people, and American troops have come home; a world where Israelis and Palestinians are each secure in a state of their own, and nuclear energy is used for peaceful purposes; a world where governments serve their citizens, and the rights of all God's children are respected.
</p>
<p>
Part of it's because of the so-called leaders of the Christian Right, who've been all too eager to exploit what divides us. The Holy Bible tells us, "Blessed are the peacemakers, for they shall be called sons of God."
</p>
<p>
And so this will be a difficult debate next week. Nor is it beyond the sea. This belief comes from my unyielding faith in the decency and generosity of the American people. We can tackle race only as spectacle - as we did in the OJ trial - or in the wake of tragedy, as we did in the aftermath of Katrina - or as fodder for the nightly news.
</p>
<p>
In a sense, what brought me to Chicago in the first place was a hunger for some sort of meaning in my life. When Washington doesn't work, all its promises seem empty. You understand that in this election, the greatest risk we can take is to try the same old politics with the same old players and expect a different result. The relationship between Islam and the West includes centuries of co-existence and cooperation, but also conflict and religious wars. These things we share.
</p>
<p>
Last time we took up immigration reform, it failed. Our conscience cannot rest until we not only secure our borders, but give the 12 million undocumented immigrants in this country a chance to earn their citizenship by paying a fine and waiting in line behind all those who came here legally. And then another one. It's a story with a simple truth: that violence is a dead end.
</p>
<p>
And slowly, I came to realize that something was missing as well - that without an anchor for my beliefs, without a commitment to a particular community of faith, at some level I would always remain apart, and alone. They are moral problems, rooted in both societal indifference and individual callousness - in the imperfections of man. What would be needed were Americans in successive generations who were willing to do their part - through protests and struggle, on the streets and in the courts, through a civil war and civil disobedience and always at great risk - to narrow that gap between the promise of our ideals and the reality of their time. The obligations that the parties have agreed to under the Road Map are clear.
</p>
<p>
I wanted to be part of something larger. I'll help our auto companies re-tool, so that the fuel-efficient cars of the future are built right here in America. Fear that because of modernity we will lose of control over our economic choices, our politics, and most importantly our identities - those things we most cherish about our communities, our families, our traditions, and our faith.

Thank you, and God bless America.
